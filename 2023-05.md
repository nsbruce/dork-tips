# Dork tips - May 2023

## Thoughts on Github, git and Microsoft

It feels a bit like cheating to simply point you at another article, but I really think this is a great read. It took about 10 minutes for me to fully digest the authors thoughts and open about 30 embedded links.

Interesting stances that author takes:

- git isn't _that_ great. There are real alternatives that don't solve every problem git has, but solve some. If we don't give them a chance or at least consider them, we might all end up locked into a piecemeal VCS that is git. The author mentions several and what he likes about them.
- Pull Requests have become the defacto standard for a coding workflow and are premised on low-trust. This _can_ be important for large teams, open-source projects, etc. but especially on a small team (even in large organizations) a high-trust environment is required to encourage independence and autonomy. A quote the author cites from a different article by Jessica Kerr is:
    > Pull requests are an improvement on working alone. But not on working together.
- there is a piece in there on Copyright vs Copyleft licensing I had to search for on DuckDuckGo. Copilot wrote the following when prompted by the word "copyleft", and I confirm it's an exact quote from the cited page:
    > Copyleft is a general method for making a program (or other work) free (in the sense of freedom, not “zero price”), and requiring all modified and extended versions of the program to be free as well. - _[Copyleft: Pragmatic Idealism](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html)_
- There is a bunch in there on Github itself being driven by profits.
- The author makes several recommendations to avoid homogenization of the developer experience. A quote he makes that resonated with me is:
    > I learn something from every new tool I use, even if it doesn’t become my new default. It makes me more resilient to change and gives me a holistic understanding what I need to develop software.

  My desire for "Dork tips" is tightly related to this sentiment.
