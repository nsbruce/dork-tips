I'm a dork at a Canadian radio astronomy observatory writing software to make radio telescopes "do their thing". In the spirit of the [TL;DR](https://tldr.tech) newsletter and taking inspiration from a co-worker who reads 1-3 new astronomy papers per day and emails us all his summaries, I thought I might start doing something similar for the software dorks out there.

I did something similar during an early phase of my PhD where I read a paper each day and posted some thoughts on it in a slack channel.

My idea for this software-related one is less academic and more about professional development. I regularly try (or at least read about) new tools to enhance the developer experience, new language features, new libraries/models, etc.

These will vary between tools, language updates, IDE tips/tricks, and general developer experience enhancements. Some might be trivial and some might be esoteric. I intend to publish them on a monthly(?) cadence. No promises.
