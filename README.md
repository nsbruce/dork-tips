# Dork tips

Taking inspiration from a co-worker who reads 1-3 new astronomy papers per day and emails us all his summaries, I thought I might start doing something similar for the software dorks at work. I did something similar during an early phase of my PhD where I read a paper each day and posted some thoughts on it in a slack channel.

My idea for this software-based one is less academic and more about professional development. I regularly try (or at least read about) new tools to enhance the developer experience, new language features, new libraries/models, etc. I'm going to start collecting them in this repo and occasionally sharing them.

These will vary between tools, language updates, IDE tips/tricks, and general developer experience enhancements. Some might be trivial and some might be esoteric.

I intend to host these on my personal website at some point and publish them on a monthly(?) cadence. No promises.

## Context

I work as a telescope computer engineer (write software to do radio telescope monitoring and control), moonlight as a PhD candidate working on radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation, and used to work in web/mobile software development. I almost exclusively work in a linux environment, but am familiar with macOS as well. I probably won't read any Windows-specific articles.

As of April 2023:

- IDE: VsCode
- Primary languages: Python, C++, Typescript, Bash, Zsh
- Shell: Zsh
- Linux distro: Ubuntu 22.04
